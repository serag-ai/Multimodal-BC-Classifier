# A Multimodal Deep Learning Model for the Classification of Breast Cancer Subtypes


## 📝 Overview

This repository contains the code supporting our research paper on **Breast Cancer Subtyping**. Our deep learning model integrates mammography images with clinical metadata to classify breast lesions into five categories: benign, Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Triple-negative.

🔬 **Key Highlights:**
- Enhancing breast cancer subtype classification by integrating mammography images with clinical metadata.
- Utilizing public breast cancer dataset for reproducibility.
- comparative analysis between unimodal (images only) and hybrid models revealed the substantial benefits of integrating clinical metadata.

## 🚀 Important

We used the CMMD dataset, a collection of breast mammography images and the corresponding clinical data for the subjects. Both images and data are publicly available in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) at [Link to dataset](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/).
